The city was historically a major European political centre.
From 1563, it was the capital of the Duchy of Savoy, then of the Kingdom of Sardinia ruled by the House of Savoy, and the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 to 1865.
Turin is sometimes called "the cradle of Italian liberty" for having been the political and intellectual centre of the Risorgimento as well as the birthplace of notable individuals who contributed to it, such as Cavour.
Although much of its political influence had been lost by World War II (having been a center of anti-fascist movements during the Ventennio including the Italian resistance), Turin became a major European crossroad for industry, commerce and trade, and is part of the "industrial triangle" along with Milan and Genoa.
It is ranked third in Italy, after Milan and Rome, for economic strength.With a GDP of $58 billion, the city is the world's 78th richest by purchasing power. As of 2018, the city has been ranked by GaWC as a Gamma-level global city.
Turin is also home to much of the Italian automotive industry, hosting the headquarters of FIAT, Lancia and Alfa Romeo.
The city has a rich culture and history, and it is known for its numerous art galleries, restaurants, churches, palaces, opera houses, piazzas, parks, gardens, theatres, libraries, museums and other venues. Turin is well known for its Baroque, Rococo, Neo-classical, and Art Nouveau architecture.
Many of Turin's public squares, castles, gardens and elegant palazzi, such as the Palazzo Madama, were built between the 16th and 18th centuries. A part of the historical center of Turin was inscribed in the World Heritage List under the name Residences of the Royal House of Savoy. In addition, the city is home to museums such as the Museo Egizio[14] and the Mole Antonelliana, the city's architectonical symbol, which in turn hosts the Museo Nazionale del Cinema. Turin's attractions make it one of the world's top 250 tourist destinations and the tenth most visited city in Italy in 2008. The city also hosts some of Italy's best universities, colleges, academies, lycea and gymnasia, such as the University of Turin, founded in the 15th century, and the Turin Polytechnic. Turin is also worldwide famous for icons like the gianduja, the Holy Shroud, the automobile brand FIAT and the association football club Juventus, which competes with its rival Torino in the Derby della Mole, the city's derby.
The city, among other events, was one of the host cities of the 1934 and 1990 FIFA World Cups, along with hosting the 2006 Winter Olympics; Turin hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 and is hosting the tennis ATP Finals from 2021 until 2025.

Swift began songwriting professionally at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country musician. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of which to country radio, starting with her self-titled album (2006).
Her next record, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) incorporated rock influences, and Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together".
She abandoned her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired her next album, the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017), and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
Swift signed a new contract with Republic Records in 2018, releasing her seventh album Lover (2019) and autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), influenced by political disillusionment.
She embraced indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore and incorporated chill-out styles on Midnights (2022). The albums broke multifarious records, led by the respective number-one singles "Cardigan", "Willow", and "Anti-Hero". After a dispute with Big Machine led to Swift re-recording her back catalog, she released two re-recorded albums, Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), in 2021; the latter's "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" became the longest song to top the Hot 100.
Swift has directed music videos and films such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021) and played supporting roles in others.
Having sold over 200 million records, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians, the most streamed woman on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. She has been featured in critical listicles such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100, and Forbes Celebrity 100. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; a Primetime Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; 12 Country Music Association Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 94 Guinness World Records. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

L'esplorazione spaziale ha catturato l'immaginazione umana da sempre.
Le missioni spaziali hanno portato all'esplorazione di altri pianeti, come Marte, e hanno fornito informazioni preziose sull'universo.
L'esplorazione spaziale ha anche contribuito allo sviluppo di nuove tecnologie e alla comprensione della nostra posizione nell'universo.
Tuttavia, ci sono ancora molti misteri da risolvere e sfide da affrontare nello spazio, come la ricerca di vita extraterrestre e la pianificazione di missioni di lunga durata nello spazio profondo.
