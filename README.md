### Universit√† degli studi di Torino - Computer Science department

This repository contains projects and exercises from my university classes, which are divided into [Triennale](Triennale/) (Bachelor projects) and [Magistrale](Magistrale/) (Master projects). Additionally, a copy of my Bachelor thesis is also available.

Some projects:
- [Checkers in Prolog](Magistrale/IALab/Progetto_Pozzato/prolog-dama) : Implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, using Prolog, to enable an intelligent system to play checkers against a human. Code developed by the me as part of a larger exam project in collaboration with other two students.
- [Naval Battle in CLIPS](Magistrale/IALab/Progetto_Micalizio/clips-battlemap) : Expert system that plays a simplified naval battle, rules and domain modeled in CLIPS. Strategies have been implemented by me and my colleagues.
- [Klingon sentence validator](Magistrale/TLN/Progetto_Mazzei) : Implementation of the CKY algorithm for parsing and sentence validity in Klingon and English, based on defined CNF Context-Free Grammars.
- [Uniti - social network for UniTo students](Magistrale/TLN/TAASS) : The project for the exam is born with the idea of creating a social network usable exclusively by UniTo students. Here is the back end of the project developed by me and a colleague.
